## Introduction

Machine Learning is a field I am passionate about, and this repository serves as a documentation of my journey in building, testing, and deploying ML models. The projects cover various ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning approaches.

Each project comes with its own **README** file that provides:

- A project description
- Methods and models used
- Model evaluation results

## Projects List

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

1. [**Twitter Sentiment Classification**](https://github.com/Rzq12/Machine-Learning-Project/tree/main/Satria%20Data)

   - **Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest
   - **Dataset:** Twitter Sentiment Dataset
   - **Description:** Analyzing 8 label from tweets.

2. [**Rock Paper Scissors Classification**](https://github.com/Rzq12/Machine-Learning-Project/tree/main/Rock%20Paper%20Scissors%20Classification)

   - **Models:** Neural Network
   - **Dataset:** Rock Paper Scissors Dataset
   - **Description:** Develop a model that accurately classifies images into one of three categories: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

3. [**Obesity Classification**](https://github.com/Rzq12/Machine-Learning-Project/tree/main/Obesity%20Classification)
   - **Models:** Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, Neural Network
   - **Dataset:** Obesity Dataset
   - **Description:** This project aims to leverage machine learning to classify different types of obesity based on factors influencing its development. By using predictive modeling, the project seeks to provide insights into obesity risk categories, which could serve as a foundation for early intervention strategies.
