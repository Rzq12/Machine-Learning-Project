# Project Description

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify images of the hand gestures used in the classic game of **Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS)**. The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient image classification model capable of identifying whether an image depicts a **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** gesture.

### Background

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple yet popular game often used for decision-making or as a fun activity. Automating the classification of these gestures provides opportunities to explore:

- **Computer Vision Techniques**: Recognizing visual patterns in images.

### Objectives

- Develop a model that accurately classifies images into one of three categories: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.
- Handle variations in lighting, hand orientation, and backgrounds effectively.
- Achieve high accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.

### Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset consisting of labeled images for the three classes:

1. **Rock**: Represented by a closed fist.
2. **Paper**: Represented by an open hand.
3. **Scissors**: Represented by a V-shaped gesture

The dataset includes diverse samples to account for variations in:

- Hand size and shape.
- Gesture orientation and positioning.

### Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Resize images to a uniform size.
   - Normalize pixel values for faster convergence during training.

2. **Model Architecture**:

   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for feature extraction and classification. CNNs are well-suited for image-based tasks due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features.

3. **Training and Evaluation**:
   - The model is trained using the processed dataset and validated on unseen data.
   - Metrics such as accuracy are used to evaluate performance.

This project demonstrates the power of computer vision techniques in a simple yet engaging context, showcasing their potential for real-world applications.

# Models and Methods

This project leverages computer vision techniques and a deep learning model to classify images of hand gestures into three categories: **Rock**, **Paper**, and **Scissors**. Below is a detailed overview of the methods and models used.

---

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Before training the model, the image data undergoes several preprocessing steps to enhance performance and generalization:

- **Resizing**:  
  All images are resized to a uniform size (e.g., 128x128 or 224x224 pixels) to standardize input dimensions for the model.

---

### 2. Model Architecture: **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is used as the backbone for this image classification task due to its ability to extract spatial and hierarchical features from images. The model architecture includes the following components:

- **Convolutional Layers**:  
  Extract local patterns such as edges, curves, and textures from input images.

- **Pooling Layers**:  
  Reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps to make the model computationally efficient and prevent overfittin

- **Fully Connected Layers**:  
  Flatten the extracted features and classify them into one of the three categories: **Rock**, **Paper**, or **Scissors**.

- **Activation Functions**:
  - **ReLU** is used in hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.
  - **Softmax** is used in the output layer to produce probabilities for the three classes.

---

### 3. Training

The model is trained using the following steps:

- **Loss Function**:  
  Cross-entropy loss is used to measure the difference between predicted and actual class probabilities.

- **Optimizer**:  
  Adam optimizer is employed for efficient and adaptive gradient-based optimization.

- **Batch Size and Epochs**:  
  The dataset is divided into small batches to improve memory efficiency, and the model is trained for multiple epochs to achieve convergence.

- **Validation**:  
  A portion of the dataset is reserved for validation to monitor the model's performance during training and avoid overfitting.

---

### 4. Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified images.

---

### 5. Potential Improvements

To further enhance the model's performance:

- Use **Transfer Learning** with pre-trained models like **ResNet**, **VGG**, or **MobileNet** for faster training and improved accuracy.
- Implement **real-time inference** for applications like interactive games or gesture-based control systems.

This methodology ensures a robust approach to classifying hand gestures in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, leveraging the power of CNNs and effective preprocessing.
